                    Earth is the only planet whose English name does not derive from Greek/Roman mythology.

                    The name derives from Old English and Germanic. There are, of course, hundreds of other names for the planet in other languages. In Roman Mythology, the goddess of the Earth was Tellus - the fertile soil (Greek: Gaia, terra mater - Mother Earth).

                    It was not until the time of Copernicus (the sixteenth century) that it was understood that the Earth is just another planet.

                    Mir and Earth's limb
                    Mir space station and Earth's limb Earth, of course, can be studied without the aid of spacecraft. Nevertheless it was not until the twentieth century that we had maps of the entire planet. Pictures of the planet taken from space are of considerable importance; for example, they are an enormous help in weather prediction and especially in tracking and predicting hurricanes. And they are extraordinarily beautiful.

                    There are also twenty or more small plates such as the Arabian, Cocos, and Philippine Plates. Earthquakes are much more common at the plate boundaries. Plotting their locations makes it easy to see the plate boundaries.
The Earth's surface is very young. In the relatively short (by astronomical standards) period of 500,000,000 years or so erosion and tectonic processes destroy and recreate most of the Earth's surface and thereby eliminate almost all traces of earlier geologic surface history (such as impact craters). Thus the very early history of the Earth has mostly been erased. The Earth is 4.5 to 4.6 billion years old, but the oldest known rocks are about 4 billion years old and rocks older than 3 billion years are rare. The oldest fossils of living organisms are less than 3.9 billion years old. There is no record of the critical period when life was first getting started.

                    There are millions of trees that are getting slashed every year for land, wood and leaves. Imagine the impact that this would have on the world – all these beautiful trees disappearing in the thousands! Did you know every day, Americans buy 62 million newspapers and throw out 44 million. This is the same as disposing 500,000 trees every week! So what can we do to help?
